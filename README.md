# Layer 1 MVP

![](<.gitbook/assets/Creative Director Reel.gif>)

Uploading/linking content. Voting it into the versioning/tracking system.

Layer 2 Content Incentive Cycle added to layer 1 user controlled history system.

Obfuscate versioning system behind editing button. Like in confluence, notify watchers features. Set this permanently/default.

I think there might be a better way to approach this though. We aren’t building an MVP/POC for the Content DAO, we are building the first layer of the Content DAO and calling it something else; once all the layers/applications are complete we pull a “this isn’t even my final form” and combine them all into the Content DAO and then pitch that.

This allows us to reuse the MVP/POCs so that we aren’t throwing away work. However, this approach is experimental so I’ll let you decide if its a good idea For V2 we might want to include a visualization tool (if thats even possible with these decentralized gits) to give new users a birds eye view of the Content DAO

#### **What is the name of the MVP?**

* Openverse
* AllWrite
* ContentHubs
* HistoryHubs
* OpenHistory
* Freeverse

{% hint style="info" %}
I had the name Canon Fodder, LLC incorporated in Delaware in 2018. I haven't kept up with the paperwork...taxes...but I can probably renew that. https://canonfodder.io
{% endhint %}



### Primary Features

Uploading/linking content

Text, images, videos, etc

Voting it into the versioning/tracking system

Discussion Where does the discussion around the content happen?

Voting Vote successful Your content gets added to the the interface Vote unsuccessful Appeal Drop Refine and resubmit Viewing the uploaded content that was voted in Does this look like an instagram feed, a reddit feed, etc? What does it look like? I’m thinking the most bare bones version is going to look more like GitHub whereas later versions will display changes more like a Google Docs (or one of those before/after image sliders). What are the use cases of the MVP? A living history book. Whereas a normal history book ends at a certain point (say 2017), a living history book is constantly being written to and because of that there is always something to read. A community controlled rulebook for a D\&D version (a community edition put together by the community; there is the centralize 5E and then there is a the decentralized Revolution edition (RE))

How do we get funding for it? Algo Scout Grant How do we build it? Devshops Build it ourselves #freelance, milk the opportunity for community engagement/learning. Upwork devs

### Themes

This changes how the data contained in the repository is represented. This determines whether it's in the form of a searchable timeline, a series of bubbles representing the data that you can click to see the content there, an instagram style feed of random content in the repository based on searched tags, etc.

&#x20;Create tasks for  Create a source-of-truth doc for the MVP Create a source-of-truth doc for the final version Create a source-of-truth doc for possible mods to the final version Create docs for features added in versions after the MVP Set up a gitbook https://www.gitbook.com/ for document management Create a task for researching the algorand scout grant

Collectively putting together a history book. Include other applications of nexus style storyline/visualization and tracking system in the grant proposal.

Situation where you’re participating in the voting process. What’s the incentive to participate in voting.

You upload something and you have a set amount of time and a fixed amount of votes you must reach in that time. If you don’t pass the threshold, you’d have to resubmit

Voting confers “karma”. Voting on lesser-known/low profile stuff confers more karma than the most high profile stuff, but upvotes = downtimes.

If I build youtube or its equivalent, … incentivbizing interaction with smaller creators. .. every creators has donation feature, once you get large enough…

Smaller creator can get up to a $50 donation from individual contributor, but individual donation amount decreases with the more people

## Wireframes and Mockups

I threw these together in 2018. They weren't all designed with an MVP in mind.

### Homepage

The dropdown menu below the hero image that reads "Girls With Guns" is intended for curated collections of content ([refer to](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1RVb7XrsziCI5MQPPWe6x0ELb7Ng-gwfdukr4ujl7dss/edit?usp=sharing) the UI for the VRV streaming platform).

### Content Creation Screen

For written content, the content creation screen draws inspiration from Medium for editing/formatting UX/UI, Google Docs for content annotation/comments (and real-time collaboration, if possible), and Discord/Slack for detailed discussions between collaborators.

Note how each new paragraph/"chunk" of text/media is assigned a four-digit hashtag for easy referencing.

### Image Collaboration Interface

I think it's unreasonable to ask artists to abandon the tools they trust in order to create and upload content to the platform. While it'd be great to give them the option of creating images directly on the platform, I'd prioritize image annotation features. One of the easiest ways I've found to highlight an area of an image when a&#x20;
